# Dense-Hessian-Bracketing

This code proposes an algorithm for optimized Dense Hessian Chain Bracketing. 

Two approaches are proposed : Approach 1 & 2 respectively. Individual README files are provided inside each folder with a detailed implementation procedure. 

The software presented here follows from our conference proceedings:
